        <h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
        <p>
            <b>
                What we did?
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this part, we implemented the Microfacet model to simulate different types of conductor materials, specifically those isotropic rough conductors that only reflect.
            To decide how the microfacets' normals are distributed, we implement the normal distribution function (NDF) with Beckmann distribution. With material roughness, we can
            compute the NDF at half vector h. We also calculate the wavelength-dependent Fresnel term for air-conductor. We look for specific \(\eta\) and \(k\) values for one material,
            plugging them into the formula to calculate the Fresnel term. With these and the shadowing-masking term, we can realize the BRDF evaluation function for this Microfacet
            model. Finally, we re-write the sampling function to implement importance sampling, calculating the actual pdf \(p_\omega(w_i)\) for the sample rays in this Microfacet model.

                Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at
                least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change
                the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.

        </p>
        <p>
            The variable \(\alpha\) is the roughness of the macro surface, and this value significantly affects how picture is rendered in Microfacet model. The smaller
            \(\alpha\) is, the smoother the macro surface will be. Visually, we see the material looks more diffuse with large \(\alpha\), and looks more glossy with small \(\alpha\).
            Here, we rendered four dragon picture with \(\alpha\)s equal to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25, and 0.5. <br />
            By comparing the pictures below, we see that with large \(\alpha\) (0.5), the dragon looks diffuse. The surfuce looks rough and does not reflect its environmental details.
            This is because the microfacets are uneven and reflecting lights to many different directions. Contrast to the large \(\alpha\), dragon with a small \(\alpha\) (0.005) appears
            to be more glossy and mirror-like, and the environmental details are reflected on the statue's surface. This is because, with a small \(\alpha\), the macro surface becomes
            smoother, and the microfacets are more aligned together.

            Comparing two pictures, we find the bunny rendered on the left has more black dots and white noise than the bunny on the right. The right bunny, which is rendered
            with importance sampling the microfacet BRDF, looks more natural and copper-like. This is because, in importance sampling, we calculate the \(p_\theta\) and \(p_\phi\) to
            resemble the \(D(h)\) (NDF with Beckmann distribution at half vector h). Acoording to the importance sampling theory, the more these pdfs resemble the NDF on h, the less
            noise we will see. With Cosine hemisphere sampling, we sample the rays based on the cos pdf on the hemisphere, and this pdf does not match with the NDF we used on our microfacet,
            which is the Beckmann distribution. As we assume the specular of the surface, the cos-hemishpere sample rays mismatch with the actual reflection rays on the microfacets.
            Therefore, we see many black spots on the rabbit. For importance sampling with NDF (Beckmann), we calculate the \(p_\omega(w_i)\) based on the microfacet and its roughness, also the
            half vector h using \(\theta, \phi\). Hence, we better incorporate the microfacet's feature and generate a better picture.

            Our team includes Zhiqi Yan and Chaomin Li. Each person came up with his
            implementations for Part 1. In addition, Chaomin did part 2, and Zhiqi did part 4. And we together did the code review and optimization. The final version includes the code from both of us.
            For the report, Zhiqi wrote the Overview and Part4, and Chaomin wrote Part 2 and contribution. We contributed equally to the project report.
            During the whole homework, we work together, learn from the each other, and discuss our implementation of different parts in this homework.
